The trendline ecuation generated based on over 1200 episodes is the following:
y = 0,2275x + 190,56

This suggests that the number or episodes needed to achieve an average score of 1600 (equivalent to eating all the dots in the game (this does not count points added by eating ghosts) is 6200 episodes.
